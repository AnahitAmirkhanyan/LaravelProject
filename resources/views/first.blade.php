    <h1>Creating a Web Page</h1>
    <p>
        This page was typed by hand. Anybody can do this, you don't need any special "web creation" tools or HTML editors, and the pages you make can be viewed from any browser. To see how this page was made, choose View Source (or View Page Source, or View Document Source) in your browser's menu (or — in at least Chrome and Firefox — Ctrl-U on your keyboard). A simple web page like this one is just plain text with HTML commands (markup) mixed in. HTML commands (properly called "tags") themselves are plain text.
        When you're just learning and want to experiment, you can do everything on your PC. Create a new directory ("folder") for your website, and then put the web-page files (HTML plus any pictures) in it. Use NotePad or other plain-text editor (not word processor) on your PC to create your "home page", a file named index.html, which you can view locally with your Web browser. (You can also use word processors such as Word or WordPad if you save in "plain text", "text", "text document", or "text document MS-DOS format".) Later I'll explain how you can install your web site on the Internet.

        Once you've made your "home page" (index.html) you can add more pages to your site, and your home page can link to them.

        <dt><i>Example for Windows:</i>

        <dd>Move your mouse cursor to the desktop.  Right-click, choose <i>New</i>,
            then choose <i>Folder</i>, and a "New Folder" appears, with its name
            highlighted.  Type "Web" to change the folder's name to Web (or anything
            else you want).  Then start NotePad to create your first Web page.
